# Introduction
# Definition of Streaming Data

Streaming data refers to the continuous flow of data that is generated in real time from various sources. This type of data is often characterized by its high volume, velocity, and variety, making it suitable for real-time processing and analysis. Examples of streaming data include social media feeds, sensor data from IoT devices, financial transactions, and user activity logs.

Key Characteristics:
- Continuous: Data is generated in an ongoing manner rather than in discrete batches.
- Real-time: Processing and analysis occur simultaneously with data generation, allowing for immediate insights.
- High Volume: Often involves large amounts of data being produced rapidly.
- Variety: Can come in various formats (text, audio, video) and from different sources.

Applications:
- Real-time analytics: Monitoring social media trends, financial markets, or system performance.
- IoT: Collecting and analyzing data from connected devices for applications like smart homes or industrial automation.
- Fraud detection: Analyzing transaction data as it occurs to identify and prevent fraudulent activities.
