## Requirements Engineering
A good system design starts with a good understanding of requirements. Requirements engineering is crucial for the successful development of systems and products, as it lays the foundation for understanding what needs to be built and ensures that all parties are aligned throughout the project lifecycle.


### Definition
Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and managing the requirements of a system or product. It involves various activities, including gathering stakeholder needs, analyzing those needs, specifying requirements, validating them, and managing changes over time.

### Key Activities in Requirements Engineering
 - Requirements Elicitation: Gathering information from stakeholders through interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation.

Requirements Analysis: Evaluating and prioritizing requirements to ensure they are feasible, necessary, and aligned with business goals\
Requirements Specification: Documenting requirements in a clear and understandable format, often using models, diagrams, and written descriptions\
<b>Requirements Validation: Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are achievable.</b>
<b>Requirements Management: Maintaining and tracking requirements throughout the project lifecycle, especially as changes occur.</b>

### Importance of Requirements Engineering
<b>Clear Understanding: Helps ensure that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the system is intended to achieve, reducing misunderstandings and miscommunications.</b>
<b>Scope Management: Aids in defining the project scope, helping to prevent scope creep by clearly documenting what is included and what is not.</b>
<b>Cost Efficiency: Identifying and addressing requirements early in the project lifecycle can significantly reduce costs associated with changes and rework later on.</b>
<b>Quality Assurance: Well-defined requirements serve as a basis for testing and validation, ensuring that the final product meets stakeholder needs and quality standards.</b>
<b>Risk Mitigation: By thoroughly understanding requirements and involving stakeholders, potential risks can be identified early, allowing for proactive management.</b>
<b>Stakeholder Satisfaction: Engaging stakeholders throughout the requirements process fosters better relationships and increases the likelihood that the final product will meet their expectations.</b>
