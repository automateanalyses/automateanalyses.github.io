## Requirements Engineering
A good system design starts with a good understanding of requirements. Requirements engineering is crucial for the successful development of systems and products, as it lays the foundation for understanding what needs to be built and ensures that all parties are aligned throughout the project lifecycle.


### Definition
Requirements engineering is the process of defining, documenting, and managing the requirements of a system or product. It involves various activities, including gathering stakeholder needs, analyzing those needs, specifying requirements, validating them, and managing changes over time.

### Key Activities in Requirements Engineering
<b>Requirements Elicitation</b>: Gathering information from stakeholders about their needs and expectations through interviews, surveys, workshops, and observation<br>
<b>Requirements Analysis</b>: Evaluating and prioritizing requirements to ensure they are feasible, necessary, and aligned with business goals<br>
<b>Requirements Specification</b>: Documenting both functional and non-functional requirements in a clear and understandable format, often using models, diagrams, and written descriptions<br>
<b>Requirements Verification and Validation</b>: Ensuring that the documented requirements accurately reflect stakeholder needs and are achievable as well as ensuring the system performs as intended<br>
<b>Requirements Management</b>: Maintaining and tracking requirements throughout the project lifecycle, especially as changes occur<br>


### Importance of Requirements Engineering
<b>Clear Understanding</b>: Helps ensure that all stakeholders have a shared understanding of what the system is intended to achieve, reducing misunderstandings and miscommunications<br>
<b>Scope Management</b>: Aids in defining the project scope, helping to prevent scope creep by clearly documenting what is included and what is not.<br>
<b>Cost Efficiency</b>: Identifying and addressing requirements early in the project lifecycle can significantly reduce costs associated with changes and rework later on<br>
<b>Quality Assurance</b>: Well-defined requirements serve as a basis for testing and validation, ensuring that the final product meets stakeholder needs and quality standards<br>
<b>Risk Mitigation</b>: By thoroughly understanding requirements and involving stakeholders, potential risks can be identified early, allowing for proactive management<br>
<b>Stakeholder Satisfaction</b>: Engaging stakeholders throughout the requirements process fosters better relationships and increases the likelihood that the final product will meet their expectations<br>

### Requirements Specification Models
Various models are used in requirements specification to represent and communicate the needs and functionalities of a system effectively. Here are some of the most common models:

#### 1. Natural Language Specifications
- **Description**: Requirements are written in plain language, making them accessible to stakeholders.
- **Advantages**: Easy to understand and flexible.
- **Disadvantages**: Can lead to ambiguity and misinterpretation without careful phrasing.

#### 2. **Use Case Diagrams**
- **Description**: Visual representations of interactions between users (actors) and the system, showing different use cases or functionalities.
- **Advantages**: Clearly illustrates user interactions and system boundaries.
- **Disadvantages**: May not provide detailed requirements.

#### 3. **User Stories**
- **Description**: Short, simple descriptions of a feature from the perspective of the end user, often following the format: "As a [user], I want [functionality] so that [benefit]."
- **Advantages**: Focuses on user needs and promotes user-centered design.
- **Disadvantages**: May lack detailed specifications and context.

#### 4. **Functional Specifications**
- **Description**: Detailed descriptions of system functionalities, often organized by features or modules.
- **Advantages**: Provides comprehensive and structured information about what the system should do.
- **Disadvantages**: Can become overly complex and hard to manage.

#### 5. **Non-Functional Requirements Specification**
- **Description**: Documents requirements related to system performance, security, usability, reliability, and other quality attributes.
- **Advantages**: Addresses critical aspects of system quality that affect user satisfaction.
- **Disadvantages**: Often less tangible and harder to quantify than functional requirements.

#### 6. **Data Flow Diagrams (DFDs)**
- **Description**: Visual representations that depict the flow of data within the system, illustrating how input is transformed into output.
- **Advantages**: Helps understand system processes and data movement.
- **Disadvantages**: Can become complex with larger systems, potentially obscuring details.

#### 7. **Entity-Relationship Diagrams (ERDs)**
- **Description**: Diagrams that represent the data model, showing entities, their attributes, and relationships between them.
- **Advantages**: Provides a clear view of data structure and relationships, crucial for database design.
- **Disadvantages**: Focused primarily on data, may not capture behavioral aspects.

#### 8. **Prototyping**
- **Description**: Creating a preliminary version of the system to visualize and test requirements.
- **Advantages**: Allows stakeholders to interact with a tangible representation of the system, facilitating feedback.
- **Disadvantages**: Can be time-consuming and may lead to premature focus on design rather than requirements.

#### 9. **State Diagrams**
- **Description**: Diagrams that illustrate the various states of a system or object and transitions between those states based on events.
- **Advantages**: Useful for modeling dynamic behavior and understanding system lifecycle.
- **Disadvantages**: Can become complex with numerous states and transitions.

#### 10. **Requirement Traceability Matrix (RTM)**
- **Description**: A table that maps requirements to their sources and related artifacts (like design elements and test cases).
- **Advantages**: Ensures that all requirements are covered in testing and development.
- **Disadvantages**: Can be cumbersome to maintain, especially in large projects.

These models serve different purposes and are often used in combination to ensure comprehensive and clear specifications of requirements. Choosing the right models depends on the project context, stakeholder needs, and the complexity of the system being developed.
